    <h1>Notify on Cache Update Demo</h1>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      <code>sw-toolbox</code>'s <code>fastest</code>
      <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/sw-toolbox/docs/master/tutorial-api">caching strategy</a>
      is a popular choice, as it offers the performance benefits of reading
      responses directly from the cache, with eventual-freshness due to the
      cache being refreshed from the network "in the background". It's
      effectively a <a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/06/01/chrome_and_stale-while-revalidate">stale-while-revalidate</a>
      approach, but implemented in a service worker.
    </p>

    <p>
      One drawback to using the <code>fastest</code> strategy is that users
      viewing the cached content on the page have no way of knowing that, when
      something has been updated from the network, that they're effectively
      looking at stale content. To address this issue, <code>sw-toolbox</code>
      has a <code>notifyOnCacheUpdate: true</code> option that can be passed in
      to the general
      <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/sw-toolbox/docs/master/tutorial-api">cache configuration</a>
      options for a given route.
    </p>

    <h3>What Do I Use notifyOnCacheUpdate?</h3>

    <p>
      Here's an example of a route and cache
      configuration, which will cause every request for a URL matching
      <code>/data/</code> to use the <code>fastest</code> strategy, store the
      responses in a cache named <code>data-cache</code>, and notify all
      pages controlled by the service worker if any previously cached entries
      have been updated.
    </p>

    <pre>toolbox.router.get(/\/data\//, toolbox.fastest, {
  cache: {
    name: 'data-cache',
    notifyOnCacheUpdate: true
  },
});</pre>

    <p>
      Update notifications are sent by the service worker to all of its client
      pages (not just the page that made the original request), and any page
      can opt-in to listening to the notifications by adding a
      <code>message</code> event listener to the
      <code>navigation.serviceWorker</code> interface:
    </p>

    <pre>if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('message', event => {
    if (event.data.type === 'cache-updated') {
      var url = event.data.url;
      // Show something in the UI to the user know that the resource
      // at `url` was updated.
    }
  });
}</pre>
    </p>

    <h3>What Headers are Checked?</h3>

    <p>
      In order to determine whether a previously cached response differs from
      the response retrieved from the network, three response headers are
      checked: <code>content-length</code>, <code>last-modified</code>, and
      <code>etag</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Out of those three, <code>content-length</code> and
      <code>etag</code> are
      <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-response-header-name">normally not available</a>
      for CORS-enabled responses, unless the remote server explicitly allows
      them via <code>access-control-allow-headers</code>. So if you are using
      this with resources fetched via CORS, make sure that the remote server
      properly sets <code>last-modified</code> or whitelists additional headers.
    </p>

    <p>
      This won't work at all with opaque responses, since those responses don't
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39109789/what-limitations-apply-to-opaque-responses">provide access</a>
      to any underlying header information.
    </p>

    <h3>Live Demo</h3>

    <p>
      The following demo is a bit contrived, and won't accomplish much when
      accessed via a production web server, since you won't be able to
      modify the <code>data/test.txt</code> file. You can run it with a local
      web server and make changes to the file to see the <code>message</code>
      event notification in action.
    </p>

    <button id="fetch">Fetch data/test.txt</button>
    <div id="test"></div>

    <script src="app.js"></script>
    <script src="../../companion.js" data-service-worker="service-worker.js"></script>
